### I. Introduction

Begin with an introduction to the role of AI in education and its specific relevance to Software Engineering. Present an overview of the key concepts or tools related to AI that you have used generally and in ICS 314. Mention which AI tools you have made use of e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, Co-Pilot

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
I didn't use help from AI during the experience WODs at home. Because they were not graded for correctness, or even complete code, I could afford to search documentation or google for help if I needed it. If I still couldn't find the help I need, I knew I had the instructor's video walkthrough of the WOD that I could review.  

  2. In-class Practice WODs
Same as the experience WODs, the in-class practice WODs weren't graded for correctness, so I opted to not seek help from AI. These often followed along the same topic or concepts as the preceding experience WODs, so I had more familiarity going into it. If I needed assistance, I would search, google, or ask for help from teammates.

  3. In-class WODs
For most of the in-class WODs, the preceding practice WODs sufficiently prepared me for the actual WOD to the point that I didn't need to seek help from AI. The searching and googling done previously were often enough, and I would know where to go exactly for the specific thing I was looking for. Some of the WODs though, I did utilize ChatGPT for help. One in particular, I completely blanked on what to do
During a few of the in-class WODs that were graded for correctness, I sometimes used Cha

  4. Essays
For some of the essays, I tried inputting the prompt into ChatGPT to see what it spits out, tried a few different variations of the prompt, such as telling it to be less technical, more bloggy, not too bloggy, but it never spat out anything good, so I didn't use any of its suggestions. I did however use it to correct any spelling or grammatical mistakes that I missed.

  5. Final project
For the final project, I didn't use ChatGPT because I wasn't sure how to efficiently feed it all the files so that it sees how my code interacts with everything. I tried using CoPilot because it could see everything, but it didn't really output anything I could use.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
The only concept that I used AI for was the topic of fundamental programming. Specifically I was trying to understand what 'map' does under the hood. Since I had only really been exposed to imperative programming, the declarative nature of 'map' was foreign to me, and I kept trying to think of it as a 'for' loop. ChatGPT said it can be conceptually thought of as one, but the 'map' function provides a "higher-level abstration" and the actual implementation is more complex and handles various edge cases, optimizations, and error checking. It also said, "in summary, higher-level abstractions offer a more conceptual, expressive, and readable way to work with programming concepts, allowing developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing implementation details", which I took as ChatGPT telling me to stop worrying about it. But it was helpful.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I did not use AI for this simply because I did not think about doing so.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
I did not use AI for this simply because I did not think about doing so.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
