### I. Introduction

Begin with an introduction to the role of AI in education and its specific relevance to Software Engineering. Present an overview of the key concepts or tools related to AI that you have used generally and in ICS 314. Mention which AI tools you have made use of e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, Co-Pilot

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
I didn't use help from AI during the experience WODs at home. Because they were not graded for correctness, or even complete code, I could afford to search documentation or google for help if I needed it. If I still couldn't find the help I need, I knew I had the instructor's video walkthrough of the WOD that I could review.  

  2. In-class Practice WODs
Same as the experience WODs, the in-class practice WODs weren't graded for correctness, so I opted to not seek help from AI. These often followed along the same topic or concepts as the preceding experience WODs, so I had more familiarity going into it. If I needed assistance, I would search, google, or ask for help from teammates.

  3. In-class WODs
For most of the in-class WODs, the preceding practice WODs sufficiently prepared me for the actual WOD to the point that I didn't need to seek help from AI. The searching and googling done previously were often enough, and I would know where to go exactly for the specific thing I was looking for. Some of the WODs though, I did utilize ChatGPT for help. One in particular, I completely blanked on what to do
During a few of the in-class WODs that were graded for correctness, I sometimes used Cha

  4. Essays
For some of the essays, I tried inputting the prompt into ChatGPT to see what it spits out, tried a few different variations of the prompt, such as telling it to be less technical, more bloggy, not too bloggy, but it never spat out anything good, so I didn't use any of its suggestions. I did however use it to correct any spelling or grammatical mistakes that I missed.

  5. Final project

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:


### IV. Practical Applications:


### V. Challenges and Opportunities:


### VI. Comparative Analysis:


### VII. Future Considerations:


### VIII. Conclusion:
