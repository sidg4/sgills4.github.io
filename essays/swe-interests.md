## There are no dumb questions, only… not smart questions?

My interest in software engineering stemmed initially from my time playing computer games, particularly World of Warcraft and Skyrim. I download many addons for those two, whether to make something more convenient, or add functionality or content to the game. I thought it was neat that regular people could add their own touches to these games developed by large video game companies, and I wanted to be able to do that. I had fun learning the little bit of programming I did with Codecademy and that eventually led to me pursuing a degree in computer science.

It was a challenge to get accustomed to programming. It requires a different way of thinking. I can’t just do something, I have to be explicit with everything that goes on in the code. Let this equal that, and now that can equal this other thing. Now that I’ve been working towards my degree for a couple years now, I’m much more used to it, and have enjoyed challenging myself. While coming up with the right algorithm can be a fun puzzle to solve, it can be mind numbing troubleshooting why code isn’t working or is doing this weird, unintended thing. It’s very satisfying to finally get it figured out and the program working. 

I’m not interested in software engineering just for the sake of programming, though. What excites me most is the ability to create a useful product for any number of areas. Almost anything of interest, I could apply my skills towards a project related to it. Create an addon for my favorite video game, a website for the local mom-and-pop shop down the street, or an application dedicated to pickleball or whatever current trend I’ve found myself following. Work for a tech giant, startup, medical company, financial institution, or in academia. A career in software engineering can go in countless different directions.

As for me, I think the possibilities presented by machine learning and artificial intelligence are fascinating and I 

would like to learn more about them. Some opportunities I have a personal interest in are predictive climate modeling, transportation optimization, and natural language processing.
I find interesting include predictive climate modeling, transportation and logistics optimization, and natural language processing. 
They are fields that I have some personal interest in, but don’t really study, though it would be awesome to gain some domain knowledge of them. 
I’d like to explore 
They are fields that I have at least some personal interest in and it would be great to gain domain knowledge of them.
